first you need to clone (i.e; copying the file from remote git repo to your local machine) the repository 
you can see https/ssh URL click https and copy the URL of the specific repository you want to "CLONE"
goto command prompt on your machine and type " git clone "copy the previous url here"
at this point your command prompt should show as users/"your machine username"
type "git status" just to be sure about your path
create a fresh branch and name it related to the changes you are making or your ticket ID 
in order to enter into that particular branch you need to checkout just as your shooping cart so type command "git checkout "branchname" "
next make changes to your branch code and make sure to save it "ctrl+s"
next use command " git add "filename" (the file which you edited in the above step 
next use "git commit -m "your message here" (like example: I changed storage from 15 to 20 GB)
next use command " git push origin "branchname" the name which you gave while creating the branch don't confuse between branch name and filename**********
you will get a url copy that and post it your team group for approvals atleast 2 approvals are needed to merge the code in real life projects after two approvals you will see merge button press that to push your changes into master/main branch
next come to your code editor scroll up to view terminal there enter git pull origin at this point your changes should reflect here
git merge main/master this is used when another team member made changes and you still didnot commit your changes but you want his/her changes reflected on your branch inorder to make your changes
other commands: git stash used to undo any command used previously 
in 14th step you path should end with your branchname make sure that by using git status command.
